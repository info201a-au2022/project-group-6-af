### Introduction

Our main question is how alcohol consumption impacts students' grades and performance at school. This question is important because alcohol consumption is rampant on college campuses, yet is is a topic which is not often discussed nor condemned within the student body. To address the question, we will use data derived from studies. We are concerned between the impact of  alcohol consumption on students in university because it is a topic which is not widely covered nor thought about. To address this concern, we plan to visualize data collected by studies.

### Problem Domain

The goal of this study is to look into the relationship between alcohol consumption and academic achievement among students. Other detrimental effects of alcohol drinking among college students will be investigated. Anne-Marie Makongho discusses the serious issue on alcohol usage among college students in a seminar paper, ["The Effect of Alcohol Use on Academic Performance of College Students"](https://minds.wisconsin.edu/bitstream/handle/1793/78353/MakonghoAnne-Marie.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y#:~:text=The%20study%20showed%20that%20alcohol,and%20negative%20mental%20health%20outcomes.&text=Several%20researchers%20have%20found%20that,academic%20performance%20including%20lowered%20GPA) that she wrote at the University of Wisconsin. She also states in her research that student alcohol consumption has been connected to a number of harmful outcomes (Makongho, 2018). Some studies have indicated that students who drink too much alcohol struggle to combine their academic work and social lives, leading to potential dropouts and failing classes. Analytics Vidhya argues that alcohol intake on weekdays lowers students' final grades, however alcohol consumption on weekends has no significant influence on final grades, according to the article ["Effect of Alcohol Use on Academic Performance of School Students"](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/effect-of-alcohol-use-on-academic-performance-of-school-students-c9ed44dafbba) (Vidhya, 2020). We also want to look into how drinking alcohol can impair academic achievement by reducing the amount of time spent studying, completing homework assignments, and attending courses. Other experts have looked into how drinking affects kids' brains as well. Ana I. Balsa believes that underage drinking can directly hinder learning by inducing changes in the structure and function of the growing brain in a new neurological study titled ["The consequences of alcohol use on academic achievement in high school."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3026599/) Alcohol abuse can have negative consequences in areas such as functioning, memory, interpretation, and attention span (Balsa, 2011). Nonetheless, the aim of our study is to see how alcohol affects students' quality of learning.

### Research Questions

1.	_In what ways does consumption of alcohol affect a student’s academic performance?_
2.	_How does alcohol impact a student’s overall health?_
3.  _Do rate of consumption and decline in academic performance have a proportional relationship?_

### The Dataset

We found this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption) on Kaggle, shared by UCI MACHINE LEARNING, and the source of this dataset is the University of Camerino. This dataset is obtained by surveying Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira secondary students in order to use data mining to predict secondary school student performance. The dataset contains 33 features and 395 observations (395 students).

The dataset only contains 395 observations and only includes students from two schools in Portugal. Therefore, there is a limitation that we may not be able to apply the results, such as correlation and causation, we found to other places. What is true in Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira may not be the same in other schools.

In addition, the data is collected through a survey of students and contains sensitive information like grades. We should doubt the reliability of such self-reported information. What is being reported may not be honest or accurate. In the dataset, features like alcohol consumption are collected using a scale from 1 to 5 (low to high). There is no clear standard, and each student may have a different scale and standard. For example, students who drink one can of alcohol a week may consider their alcohol consumption to be 1, as one can per week is not a lot, and students who do not drink alcohol may also consider their alcohol consumption to be 1. Many features use scale rating so that such inaccuracy could exist in the dataset.

Our goal is to see how activities, such as alcohol consumption, will impact the performance of a student. However, there is no random assignment, so there is no experimental and control group. As a result, it would be hard to discover any casual relationship.

### Key Findings

The implications can vary based on whether the results of alcohol consumption in our study return positive, neutral, or negative impacts on a student’s performance/grades. If alcohol consumption negatively impacts students’ performance/grades, then policymakers will have to take this into account when creating an age limit on alcohol purchases. Technologists would have to limit alcohol-related ads and influences in order to make an effort to decrease students’ consumption. On the other hand, if there is no negative impact, then designers may target those students more in order to increase sales. Another implication could be resulted by positive impacts on students’ performance/grades. This implication could be policymakers decreasing the age limit on alcohol purchases. It could also be that students become a larger target market in the alcohol industry which would lead to technologists and designers working more with students to better fit their specific needs to generate more sales for companies.
