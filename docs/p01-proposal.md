**Code Name:** Mass Shootings US

**Affiliation:** INFO-201: Technical Foundations of Informatics - The Information School - University of Washington

**Date:** Autumn 2022

**Abstract:**
Our main question is how a large number of mass shootings have occurred in the United States for each state. This question is important because we are not only talking about a mere statistic here, but these are also human lives we are talking about. People who will not see their families ever again. To address the question, we will use all the data we can find on the internet and the coding skills we have learned during class. We are concerned with addressing this topic as respectfully as possible because we are aware of how sensitive this topic is.

**Keywords:**
*Mass Shootings, Gun-Violence, Gun-policies, Firearms, Mental Health*

**Introduction:** Gun Violence in the United States of America is not recent news, unfortunately. The number of mass shootings has increased in the past couple of years. Nowadays mass shootings are so common that a big part of the population in America is now considering removing the “Right To Arms” from the amendments of the Constitution. This is a very controversial topic in the United States today, and we can see the difference of opinions between the Republicans (PRO-Guns) and Democrats (Anti-Guns). In this project, we will show the data on how many of these incidents have happened in the last thirty years nationwide.


**Problem Domain:** *Gun violence* is a contemporary issue in American politics which is incredibly polarized, and thus it is important to be able to access reliable data which can inform policy makers, the public, and victims



It concerns human life, and the American consciousness, for America is a country which prides itself in its guns. Guns are a key pillar of America’s foundation having entered the national ethos through the constitution.  The _direct stakeholders_ are the victims of gun violence as well as policy makers whose actions define the situation in the ground. The _indirect stakeholders_ are the general American public as a whole and its tolerance to sustain further violent incidents which results in the deaths of many hundreds each year



- The possible harms of codifying this data in one massive dataset is that it may be used to politically gain the side which stands for less gun restrictions as a means to argue for the further militarization of the American public. According to the [BBC]( https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081) there are 120 guns for every 100 Americans. The country with the 2nd highest quota of gun ownership is Yemen with 52.8. In the year 2020 alone 19,384 homicides were committed with guns.



- The [New York Times]( https://www.nytimes.com/article/mass-shootings-2022.html) drive the severity of the issue home by highlighting that this year alone there have been 531 mass shootings. Incidents such as the one on May 13 where 16 people were wounded by gunfire in a shooting in downtown Milwaukee are evermore commonplace within the United States.



- Not only are mass shootings becoming more frequent, they are also becoming deadlier. The 5 worst mass shootings in US history have all occurred within the last 10 years. The most recent one to enter the list was Sutherland Springs, Texas with 26 people dying.


- [Health Affairs]( https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/briefs/mass-shootings-united-states-population-health-policy-levers) the current state of affairs as an “epidemic”.

Around 80% percent of the weapons used in mass shootings were obtained legally, so it is very much a topic which concerns policy makers. The stakeholders are everyone in America for the fear of gun violence is omnipresent and some research suggests that people’s anxiety is spiked when they are in large areas due to the huge coverage of mass shooting events.

**Research Questions:**
1. _How many mass shootings happened in each state for the past thirty years?_

This is our top priority in this research. We believe that by finding the numbers of how many mass shootings that happened in each state we could eventually compare why there are more shootings in one state than another and find a solution to this problem.

2. _Why has the Second Amendment become such a controversial topic between the Democratic and the Republican party?_

Just like everything else nowadays this has turned political and now a lot of politicians from both parties are campaigning for or against the Second Amendment.

3. _Why is there a great percentage of the population still want to keep their “Right To Bare Arms” after all the mass shootings that have happened?_

This is a crucial question for our research because without guns mass shootings would not occur, so there must be a good reason for wanting to keep the Second Amendment at all costs.

4. _Where does the police stand in all these? It is also true that many of the murders of innocent people have been caused by police forces. So, should we take guns from police officers as well?_


**The Dataset:** The data sets that we are using come from multiple organizations which work to track gun violence, specifically mass shootings, in the US.  We will look at the US gun violence archive website, an independent data collection and research group, which collects data from “over 7,500 law enforcement, media, government and commercial sources daily” and stores it in an online archive of all gun violence incidents that happen in the United States. Another data set we will look at comes from The Violence Project, a non-profit/non-partisan research center working to reduce violence in society and develop new policies and practices. This particular group benefits all communities by delivering education and creating training for K-12 schools, universities and colleges, workplaces, houses of worships, public settings, and private clients, and any other public gathering places. A similar organization that has data sets on mass shootings in America is the Everytown Research Organization. We plan to use their data sets with specific filters on the types of mass shootings that occur. All of the data sets we will be using for our project are credible and can be validated because they come from nationwide organizations who have no affiliation to any political parties in the US. It is important for us to use data from groups that do not have bias in their methods of collecting data or certain opinions on guns and gun policies in the US.

The particular data we are looking at pertains to our research question because it holds information about all the US mass shootings that happened in 2022. We can filter specific data to find answers and explanations for each of our research questions.

**Expected Limitations:** Obviously, the ones that will be more affected by the answers to these questions will be policymakers. With this information, they can look at what type of change the people want and campaign with it. Eventually, if they make it to the government, they can set policies that will benefit most of the population in general. Technologists may find an anti-shooter system, which would be like a protocol people need to follow carefully to reduce casualties as much as possible and eventually apprehend and bring them to justice. Finally, the designers will not see themselves affected that much by this topic because is not their area of work.

**Limitations:** We acknowledge that our project proposal is really ambitious, and there may be various challenges along the way. Our main limitation may be finding all the necessary data to do a completely reliable project with all the fact-checked and verified sources. We are also aware that this project will require lots and lots of lines of coding so taking into account we have just begun learning the basic concepts of R studio, Atom, and Git Hub this may also be quite challenging. Giving the Website the proper style and form will also require a lot of work so we must be prepared to do that as well as possible. Last but definitely not least will be to coordinate between the group members, most of us have very tight schedules and because we are during Covid-19 and Flu season, meetings may not occur with the frequency we would like to.
