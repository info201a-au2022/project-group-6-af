### Abstract

Our main question is how alcohol consumption impacts students' grades and performance at school. This question is important because alcohol consumption is rampant on college campuses, yet is is a topic which is not often discussed nor condemned within the student body. To address the question, we will use data derived from studies. We are concerned between the impact of  alcohol consumption on students in university because it is a topic which is not widely covered nor thought about. To address this concern, we plan to visualize data collected by studies.

### Keywords

Keywords: student behavior; school performance; alcohol consumption impact

### Introduction

Our project analyzes the link between student grade performance and student alcohol consumption. We hope to establish a link between the amount of alcohol consumed and negative impact on grade point average. Whilst our first project was based on a different premise entirely, this prompt comes to us more naturally, for being part of the more social areas of UW student live, we often times find ourselves in situation where drinks are being consumed. We wonder how said consumption may impact school performance.  

We want to uncover the popularity behind binge drinking, and we want to learn student’s motivation for binge drinking when it is well established that it is both illegal and detrimental.

### Problem Domain

The stakeholders are college students and the indirect stakeholders are general society. Binge drinking has a lot of detrimental effects on a student’s health. A change in GPA may be the easiest most statistic way to measure the effects of alcohol, but the impacts on health are more severe and more poignant. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism discusses the serious issue on alcohol usage among college students in an article, ["College Drinking"](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/college-drinking).
Binge drinking is correlated with sexual assault, alcohol use disorder, and even death. Binge drinking fosters cultures where sexual assault and assault are tolerated. Some studies have indicated that students who drink too much alcohol struggle to combine their academic work and social lives, leading to potential dropouts and failing classes. Analytics Vidhya argues that alcohol intake on weekdays lowers students' final grades, however alcohol consumption on weekends has no significant influence on final grades, according to the article ["Effect of Alcohol Use on Academic Performance of School Students"](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/effect-of-alcohol-use-on-academic-performance-of-school-students-c9ed44dafbba) (Vidhya, 2020). We also want to look into how drinking alcohol can impair academic achievement by reducing the amount of time spent studying, completing homework assignments, and attending courses. Other experts have looked into how drinking affects kids' brains as well. Ana I. Balsa believes that underage drinking can directly hinder learning by inducing changes in the structure and function of the growing brain in a new neurological study titled ["The consequences of alcohol use on academic achievement in high school."](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3026599/) Alcohol abuse can have negative consequences in areas such as functioning, memory, interpretation, and attention span (Balsa, 2011). Nonetheless, the aim of our study is to see how alcohol affects students' quality of learning. The possible harms and benefits are potentially far reaching. The benefits of uncovering this topic are that it can lead to more awareness overall which is currently not widespread. Binge drinking is indicative of bigger societal trends such as rape culture. Drinking does not enable bad behavior, it simply brings it out more easily. The harms are that this data simply has no impact at all/ is not taken seriously. Drinking is viewed as funny and youthful by major subsets in society. Toxic stereotypes such as “boys will be boys” all confirm notions that drinking excesses are simply part of college life. This is especially prevalent in Greek Life. We want to frame this project as a conversation starter rather than just a data visualization.

### Limitations
s
The dataset we use is small containing only 395 students and only focuses on two sets of students from two schools in Portugal. The limitation with a dataset this minuscule is that we might not be able to apply and compare the results to other places around the world. What is found to be true with the students at Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira may not be the same in other schools.

Another big limitation in our study is that the data is collected via a survey of students and relies on self-reported information from the students. Our concern is that with this data collection method, the data being reported may not be accurate or honest. The student survey uses a scale from 1 to 5 (low to high), to collect student alcohol consumption levels. A limitation with this technique is that it gives no clear standard to students to compare their alcohol consumption and each student may have a different standard or scale when asked what a low or high level of consumption is.

Our goal with this study is to see how alcohol consumption plays a role in impacting the performance of students in school. Nonetheless there is no standard assignment that every student completes as a test and no experimental or control groups. Due to this fact, it is hard for us to come to an accurate conclusion on the relationship of alcohol consumption and academic success.


### The Dataset

The dataset that we are using in our study can be found on Kaggle, shared by the UCI Machine Learning (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption). The source of this dataset comes from researchers at the University of Camerino, and is obtained by surveying a total of 395 students from two secondary schools in Portugal. The two schools are Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira secondary schools. The goal of the researchers at University of Camerino is to try and find answers to questions regarding alcohol consumption and its impacts on student grades. We know that the dataset is credible because it comes from a well-known University which has a history of doing research on students from several countries in Europe and is reputable. The previously mentioned dataset contains 33 features and 395 observations, one for each student that entered information into the survey.
